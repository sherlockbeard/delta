    The "CHANGE_THIS" value will be replaced by HiveCatalogExtension during test setup phase. Every
    Test run will use Hive server running on a different port. It's safer to let the Operating
    System to assign the port, that we know that will be free on particular machine rather than hard
    code port number. Hard coding port number could case random test failures on some machine where
    this port could be already assigned to other application. !-->
